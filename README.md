# Enterprise Conversation Plugins for a Symbl.ai

The goal of this repository is to provide both:

- an "App Store"-like experience to enabling and extending functionality for your [Symbl.ai Enterprise Application](https://github.com/dvonthenen/enterprise-reference-implementation)
- a place for community members to share and contribute their general purpose conversation plugins, workflows, ideas, etc

## Brief Recap: Symbl.ai Enterprise Application

If you aren't familiar with the [Symbl.ai Enterprise Application](https://github.com/dvonthenen/enterprise-reference-implementation), you can find more information about this Architecture in the repo found here: [https://github.com/dvonthenen/enterprise-reference-implementation](https://github.com/dvonthenen/enterprise-reference-implementation).

In short, this Enterprise Application Architecture provides a reusable, off-the-shelf implementation for Conversation Analytics that provides the following benfits:

- Build applications with a historical conversation context
- Persist conversation insights (data ownership)
- Build scalable conversation applications
- Companyâ€™s business rules/logic pushed into backend server microservices
- Dashboards, dashboards, dashboards
- Historical data is air-gapped and can be backed up
- UI isolation. Change all aspects of UI frameworks without changing the code
- Also supports Asynchronous analysis of data

This is a high-level block diagram for what the architecture looks like...

**Realtime and Asynchronous Conversation Process**
To deploy this configuration, follow each setup guide above. The setup is independent of each other and the only share components between these two configurations are the [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) Database and [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com/) Server.
